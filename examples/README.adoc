IMPORTANT: These examples all **require** a running Sentry instance as a valid
**DSN** is needed for the examples to work correctly!

== Basic

A simple example that shows how to create a sentry-logger and use it to fire
an event to Sentry. All this is done via a little commentary in a Rich Comment
Block, thus runnable in the REPL.

== Uncaught

Another simple example that shows how we can switch off the built-in uncaught
exception handler in the Sentry client, thus allowing us to define our
handler.

The handler which we define not only fires an event to Sentry, but also logs
out to a pre-configured logger. This small example is run on the command line
as:

`bin/run -d DSN`

Where `DSN` is your DSN URL.
