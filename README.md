# sentry-clj

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/io.sentry/sentry-clj.svg)](https://clojars.org/io.sentry/sentry-clj)

A very thin wrapper around the [official Java library for
Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/).

This project follows the version scheme MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS where MAJOR and
MINOR provide some relative indication of the size of the change, but do not
follow semantic versioning. In general, all changes endeavour to be
non-breaking (by moving to new names rather than by breaking existing names).
COMMITS is an ever-increasing counter of commits since the beginning of this
repository.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[sentry-clj.core :as sentry])

; You can initialize Sentry manually by providing a DSN in the code (as shown below),
; or use one of the other configuration options (such as environment variables) described
; in the Java SDK documentation (which will automatically initialize Sentry the first
; time you attempt to send an event): https://docs.sentry.io/clients/java/config/

(sentry/init! "https://public:private@sentry.io/1")

(try
  (do-something-risky)
  (catch Exception e
    (sentry/send-event {:throwable e})))
```

## Supported event keys

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/)

- `:breadcrumbs` - a collection of `Breadcrumb` maps. See below.
- `:dist` - a `String` which identifies the distribution.
- `:environment` - a `String` which identifies the environment.
- `:event-id` - a `String` id to use for the event. If not provided, one will be automatically generated.
- `:extra` - a map with `Keyword` or `String` keys (or anything for which `clojure.core/name` can be invoked) and values which can be JSON-ified. If `:throwable` is given, this will automatically include its `ex-data`.
- `:fingerprint` - a sequence of `String`s that Sentry should use as a [fingerprint](https://docs.sentry.io/learn/rollups/#customize-grouping-with-fingerprints).
- `:level` - a `Keyword`. One of `:debug`, `:info`, `:warning`, `:error`, `:fatal`. Probably most useful in conjunction with `:message` if you need to report an exceptional condition that's not an exception.
- `:logger` - a `String` which identifies the logger.
- `:message` - a map containing Message information. See below.
- `:platform` - a `String` which identifies the platform.
- `:release` - a `String` which identifies the release.
- `:request` - a map containing Request information. See below.
- `:server-name` - a `String` which identifies the server name.
- `:tags` - a map with `Keyword` or `String` keys (or anything for which `clojure.core/name` can be invoked) and values which can be coerced to `Strings` with `clojure.core/str`.
- `:throwable` - a `Throwable` object. Sentry's bread and butter.
- `:transaction` - a `String` which identifies the transaction.
- `:user` - a map containing User information. See below.

### Breadcrumbs

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/breadcrumbs/)

When an event has a `:breadcrumbs` key, each element of the value collection
should be a map. Each key is optional.

- `:type` - A `String`
- `:level` - a `String`
- `:message` - a `String`
- `:category` - a `String`
- `:data` - a map with `String` keys and `String` values

### Message

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/message/)

When an event has a `:message` key, the following data should be contained
within a map, thus:

- `:formatted` - A `String` containing the fully formatted message. If missing, Sentry will try to interpolate the `message`.
- `:message` - An optional `String` containing the raw message. If there are params, it will be interpolated.
- `:params` - An optional sequence of `String`'s containing parameters for interpolation, e.g., `["foo" "bar"]

### User

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/user/)

When an event has a `:user` key, the data following should be contained within
a map. You should provide at either the id or the ip-address.

- `:email` - A `String`
- `:id` - A `String`
- `:username` - A `String`
- `:ip-address` - A `String`
- `:other` - A map containing key/value pairs of `Strings`, i.e., `{"a" "b" "c" "d"}`

### Request

[API Documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/request/)

When an event has a `:request` key, the data should be contained within a map.
Each key is optional.

- `:url` - A `String`
- `:method` - A `String`
- `:query-string` - A `String`
- `:data` - An arbitrary value (e.g., a number, a string, a blob...)
- `:cookies` - A `String`
- `:headers` - A map containing key/value pairs of `Strings`, i.e., `{"a" "b" "c" "d"}`
- `:env` - A map containing key/value pairs of `Strings`, i.e., `{"a" "b" "c" "d"}`
- `:other` - A map containing key/value pairs of `Strings`, i.e., `{"a" "b" "c" "d"}`
